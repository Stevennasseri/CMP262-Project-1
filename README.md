# CMP262-Project-1
 Steven Nasseri Project 1 files

 this repo has all the ipynb files associated with my project as well as the original and then cleaned csv files.
 I included both parts of this project, with NasseriProject1.ipynb being the same work done for assignment 5.
 the second part is NasseriProject1Analysis.ipynb, and that file contains all my code relating to part two 
 including the original questions and answers we came up with. Please note that I didn't have this repo set up while doing this project, 
 so the path in the ipynb files will have to be changed to properly load the data. 
 the word document thats also in this repo contains the written questions and instructions for part1 of th project.
 thank you for reading!
